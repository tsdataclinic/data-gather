        <li>Other uses about which we notify you.</li>
      </BulletList>
      <P>
        We may also use and disclose personal information for compliance with
        applicable laws and regulations, and we may combine the information we
        collect (“aggregate”) or remove pieces of information (“de-identify”) to
        limit or prevent identification of any user or device, and use such
        aggregate and de-identified information for any purpose.
      </P>
      <P>
        We may also disclose this information to third parties for legal,
        compliance or security purposes or based on your elections, in
        connection with a business transfer or successor to all or part of the
        business, or our affiliates.
      </P>
      <H3>C. Sale/Sharing of Personal Information</H3>
      <P>
        The CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that “sell”
        personal information or “share” personal information for cross-context
        behavioral advertising purposes with third parties who do not act as
        service providers to that business. Two Sigma makes personal information
        available to non-service provider third parties only when individuals
        have affirmatively agreed to such disclosure (for example, where a site
        visitor has opted in to our use of advertising cookies) or where the
        disclosure of personal information is otherwise exempt from the CCPA
        (such as disclosing information to secure the Services). As such, Two
        Sigma does not “sell” or “share” personal information within the meaning
        of the CCPA.
      </P>
      <P>
        Please note, in the limited circumstances that we process sensitive
        personal information as defined in the CCPA, we do not use or disclose
        it other than for disclosed and permitted business purposes for which
        there is not a right to limit under the CCPA.
      </P>
      <H3>D. Your Personal Information Rights</H3>
      <P>
        California residents may make certain requests about their personal
        information under the CCPA, subject to certain limitations and/or
        restrictions. Specifically, under California law you have the right to:
      </P>
      <BulletList>
        <li>
          Request that we disclose information about the personal information
          that we have collected, used, disclosed or sold,
        </li>
        <li>
          Request access to a copy of the personal information we maintain about
          you;
        </li>
        <li>Request correction of inaccurate personal information;</li>
        <li>
          Request that we delete personal information collected from you; and
        </li>
        <li>
          Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your privacy
          rights.
        </li>
      </BulletList>
      <P>
        A consumer may use an authorized agent to submit a request on their
        behalf. When using an authorized agent, we require that you provide the
        authorized agent written permission to do so and verify their own
        identity and agent status with us. If you would like to designate an
        authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, please email us at{' '}
        <a href="mailto:CCPA@twosigma.com">CCPA@twosigma.com.</a>
      </P>
      <P>
        If you require this notice in an alternative accessible format, please
        email us at <a href="mailto:CCPA@twosigma.com">CCPA@twosigma.com.</a>
      </P>
      <P>
        We have instituted a process for verifying that the person making an
        access, correction or deletion request is the consumer about whom we
        have collected information. Whenever feasible, we will match at least
        two data points in the identifying information provided by the consumer
        to the personal information already maintained by us, but it may require
        more data points depending on the information requested. We will avoid
        collecting highly sensitive pieces of personal information, unless
        necessary. For online requests to delete, we will use a two-step process
        where the consumer must first submit the deletion request and then
        separately confirm that they want their personal information deleted. If
        we cannot verify your identity in accordance with California law, we may
        deny your request in whole or in part.
      </P>
      <P>
        For requests to know and requests to delete, we will confirm receipt of
        the request within ten (10) days and provide information about how the
        business will process the request, and we will respond within 45 days
        with an option to extend an additional 45 days provided we give you
        notice.
      </P>
      <P>
        If you wish to exercise any of your rights undf these methods: (i) email
        us at <a href="mailto:CCPA@twosigma.com">CCPA@twosigma.com;</a> (ii)
        contact us at the toll-free telephone number{' '}
        <a href="tel:+18448206577">1-844-820-6577;</a> or (iii) submit a webform
        request here.
      </P>

      <H3>E. Shine the Light</H3>
      <P>
        California Law permits customers who are California residents to request
        certain information once per year regarding our disclosure of “personal
        information” (as that term is defined under applicable California law)
        to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. We
        do not disclose personal information to third parties for their own
        direct marketing purposes.
      </P>
      <H3>F. Data Retention</H3>
      <P>
        We generally retain personal data for so long as it may be relevant to
        the purposes set forth in the relevant privacy policy. In determining
        how long to retain information, we consider the amount, nature and
        sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from
        unauthorized use or disclosure of the information, the purposes for
        which we process the information, applicable legal requirements, and our
        legitimate interests. The purposes for which we process information (as
        well as the other factors listed above) may dictate different retention
        periods for the same types of information. For example, we retain a
        record of your inquiries to us for as long as it takes to fulfill the
        inquiry. If you opt out of email marketing, we maintain your email on
        our suppression list for an extended time to comply with your request.
        To dispose of your information, we may de-identify it, delete it or take
        other appropriate steps. Data may persist in copies made for backup and
        business continuity purposes for additional time.
      </P>

      <P>
        Our Sites are meant for adults. We do not knowingly collect personal
        information from children under 13 without permission from a parent or

        Personal information we collect may be transferred to and stored within
        the United States. Our Sites are subject to U.S. laws, which may not
        afford the same level of protection as those in your country. We will
        take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal
        information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy
        Policy. If you live outside of the United States, you understand and
        agree that we may transfer your personal information to the United
        States. You acknowledge that if you do not consent or would like to
        withdraw your consent to such transfer by contacting{' '}
        <a href="mailto:GDPR@twosigma.com">GDPR@twosigma.com,</a> it will impact

      <H2>reCAPTCHA</H2>
      <P>
        We use the reCAPTCHA service provided by Google Inc. (Google) to protect
        your submissions via internet submission forms on this site. This plugin
        checks if you are a person in order to prevent certain website functions
        from being (ab)used by spam bots (particularly comments). This plugin
        query includes the sending of the IP address and possibly other data
        required by Google for the Google reCAPTCHA service. For this purpose
        your input will be communicated to and used by Google. However, your IP
        address is previously truncated by Google within member states of the
        European Union or in other states which are party to the agreement on
        the European Economic Area and is, as such, anonymized. Only in
        exceptional cases is a full IP address transmitted to a Google server in
        the United States and truncated there. On behalf of the operator of this
        website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of this
        service. The IP address provided by reCaptcha from your browser shall
        not be merged with any other data from Google.
